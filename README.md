### Technology

Hosted on [Netlify](https://netlify.com)

- Gatsby + React
- react-select
- tailwindcss
- Item data from minecraft-data (MC Version 1.14)
- Item images hosted on DO Spaces

And a few more! This will be updated soon.

*Why Gatsby?*

In this early stage this is only a single page site.
But I have a few feature ideas that will be added soon, such as an editor for colored text (For use in configs and chat) based on a HTML like syntax.

### Report missing item images

Please use [this issue](https://github.com/JoschuaSchneider/snapcraft/issues/1) to report missing item images.


**Work in progress, this is the first Hacky version!! Feel free to report issues :)**
